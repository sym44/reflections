Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: When initializing the reflection repo, it turns out no commits have been
done before. 

git init //to initialize a new repo of existing directory

Q2: How is staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: staging area is the same thing as git index. It is temporary area between
working directory and git directory. add-> index/staging area, commit-> git
directory.

git add <path>   working directory->staging area
git reset HEAD <path> remove from staging area to working directory
