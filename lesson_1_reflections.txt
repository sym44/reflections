1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: When there are typo in the new version, bugs are highly possible in the program.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: When you can view what you have been making improvements or modifications, you can know what did you think at the last time, and how do you improve through out the whole process.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A:
Pros: You can control when to commit, to avoid too large or small commit each time. And this will help to build a more logical version control system.
Cons: If you are forgetable person, then manually commit may have a risk of not saving certain version of the program.
